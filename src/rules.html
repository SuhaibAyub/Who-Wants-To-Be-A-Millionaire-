    <p>In this game, the user's goal is to correctly answer a set of fifteen multiple-choice questions.
        Each question is worth a specified amount of money; the amounts are cumulative as the rounds increase from one to three. If the contestant answers three questions incorrectly, the game is over and the contestant's winnings are reduced to the banked amount.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Questions 1–5: 60 seconds</li>
        <li>Questions 6–10: 45 seconds</li>
        <li>Questions 11–15: 30 seconds</li>
    </ul>

<p>
    The timer will begin to run as soon as the user clicks the "Round 1" button, and the contestant has to give a final answer before the time reaches zero. If time runs out, the game ends and the contestant left with whatever money they had will win to that point.
        
    If the contestant ran out of time after they had banked a certain amount of cash, they will walk away with the banked amount.

    <h4>Banked amounts</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>5 Questions: $7500 Banked</li>
        <li>10 Questions: $75,000 Banked</li>
        <li>15 Questions: $1,000,000(WINNER)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    If the banked button is pressed at any point throughout the game, the game will end and user will walk away with what they have banked.
